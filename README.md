Background/Research Objective
=================================================================================

Wildlife research has significantly benefited from the use of infrared cameras to detect and capture movement from animals.

Thousands of images can be taken from these cameras over periods of months or years. The task of sifting through the images is highly laborious. Automating this process using machine learning would remove the repetition of having to identify the species of animal in each picture.

Dataset
=================================================================================

The dataset that we used for our project consisted of images taken by wildlife cameras, courtesy of Dr. Rachael Urbanek from environmental science at UNCW.

A majority of the images were labeled by the species of animal found in the picture, some were ghost images, being there is no animal present at all. There were images that were unlabelled, which were the ones we attempted to classify. 

In total, our dataset included several hundred images of species like bears, deers, foxes, coyotes, rodents, and more.
